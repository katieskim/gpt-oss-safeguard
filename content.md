# Influencer Content Classification Guidelines (MPAA-Style System)

This document provides a complete, content-based classification system for evaluating influencers.
It is modeled after age-suitability film rating systems (e.g., MPAA: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17) and is intended for use in influencer screening, risk assessment, and partnership eligibility decisions.

The system categorizes influencers strictly based on the **nature, tone, and maturity level of their content**, not on brand fit, engagement rate, or performance.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Classification System

This system establishes standardized content-suitability categories for influencers.It ensures that organizations can consistently:

- Identify content risk levels
- Align influencer choices with safety requirements
- Filter out inappropriate or high-risk profiles
- Maintain compliance and protect reputation
- Build objective criteria for influencer approval

The system is universal and can be applied across all platforms, including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X/Twitter, and others.

# 2. Rating Categories Overview

The system includes five primary content categories:

1. **I-G** – General Audience
2. **I-PG** – Parental Guidance Suggested
3. **I-PG13** – Parents Strongly Cautioned
4. **I-R** – Restricted
5. **I-NC17** – Adults Only

Each category is defined by its allowable content themes, language, imagery, tone, and presentation.

# 4. Cross-Category Considerations

Regardless of category, the following areas must always be reviewed:

### 4.1 Consistency of Content

Ratings must reflect dominant content themes, not isolated posts.

### 4.2 Hidden or Secondary Accounts

Alternate accounts must be included if publicly linked.

### 4.3 Audience Reaction

Comment sections, live streams, and interactions must be checked for tone and maturity level.

### 4.4 Frequency and Recency

If mature content appears frequently or recently, the classification defaults to the higher-risk category.

---

# 5. Classification Decision Rules

The classifier should follow these principles:

1. **Rate conservatively:** If uncertain between two categories, select the more restrictive.
2. **Classify based on majority content:** Occasional deviations do not override consistent themes.
3. **Update periodically:** Influencer content evolves and must be re-evaluated.
4. **Use platform-wide assessment:** Consider posts, stories, highlights, reels, lives, and link-in-bio destinations.
5. **Explicit material overrides all:** Any explicit nudity or erotic content immediately qualifies as I-NC17.

# 6. Usage Recommendations

This classification system can be applied in:

- Influencer approval workflows
- Risk and reputation management screening
- Automated AI evaluation systems
- Marketing compliance processes
- Agency and brand partner guidelines
